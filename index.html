                    <p>Steven Universe is a human-Gem hybrid as a result of his parentage, Steven is an extraordinarily unique being with innate powers beyond that of both normal humans and Gems. While only a child, Steven has steadily grown from a tag-along to the Crystal Gems into an equal among their ranks thanks to his kind-hearted nature and resourcefulness. Though he is part of a monumental legacy, Steven is devoted to fulfilling his destiny as protector of humanity, just as his mother was before him.</p>
